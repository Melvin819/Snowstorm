# Snowing throughout the night

## Artist Statement
Snowstorm is a piece that reflects a moment from my childhood when I would look out the window and see the snow falling as the wind drives the snow. This piece is meant to be a peaceful image of my childhood, when snowfall was more common to see, and snow was abundant to make a snow angel.
