# Snowing throughout the night
It is meant to reminisce about the past and evoke a feeling of tranquility.

## Artist Statement
"Snowstorm" is a piece that reflects a moment from my childhood when I would look out the window and watch the snow falling, driven by the wind. This piece aims to capture a peaceful image of my youth, a time when snowfall was more frequent and there was plenty of snow to make snow angels.
